# Monty Hall Problem Bayesian Network
# Models the famous Monty Hall game show probability puzzle
#
# Network Structure:
#
#   PrizeDoor
#      |
#      v
#  SelectedDoor    -->    MontyOpens
#
# Characteristics:
# - Small 3-variable model with multi-valued variables
# - Models the famous probability puzzle
# - Good for demonstrating counter-intuitive probability results
# - Shows importance of conditional dependencies
# - Can be used to prove why switching doors is optimal strategy
