# Build Scripts

This directory contains utility scripts for building, testing, releasing, and maintaining the BayesCalc2 project.

## Script conventions 

All scripts support dry-run (with option `--dry-run`) which allows to see the commands to be executed but will not execute them.
When a script is suitable for usage in a CI/CD pipeline (e.g. `mkbld.sh` script) it will auto-detect when
running in a pipeline and remove colored output. Finally all scripts support an extensive `--help` function.

To report on progress scripts are usually divided in phases whcih will print a header. In these headers
the following "glyphs" are used as a visual aid to what activity is going on

- üöÄ for "Starting"
- üîç for "Validation"
- üß™ for "Testing"
- üìù for "Preparation"
- üéØ for "Execution"
- üßπ for "Cleanup"
- üì¶ for "Package"
- ‚úÖ for "Success"
- ‚ùå for "Error"
- ‚ö†Ô∏è for "Warning"
- ‚è≥ for "Pending/Waaiting"

## Scripts Overview

### `mkbld.sh` - Main Build Script

The primary build script that runs the complete build pipeline:

```bash
./scripts/mkbld.sh [OPTIONS]
```

This script is suitable to run regularly while developing to continuesly be aware that the system has not been broken.
In addition this is the primary CI/CD script that is automatically run on GitHub for each push. This makes it obvious to
detect a commit that "breaks the build". 

**Pipeline Steps:**
1. Run tests with coverage (‚â•80% required)
2. Update coverage badge in README.md (local only)
3. Run flake8 static analysis
4. Run mypy type checking
5. Check code formatting with black
6. Clean previous builds
7. Build package (wheel + source distribution)
8. Validate package with twine

**Options:**
- `--dry-run` - Show commands without executing them
- `--help` - Display help message

**Requirements:**
- Python 3.10+
- Virtual environment activated (`.venv/bin/activate`)
- All dev dependencies installed (`pip install -e ".[dev]"`)

**Output:**
- Test coverage report: `htmlcov/index.html`
- Coverage XML: `coverage.xml`
- Built packages: `dist/`

### `update_coverage_badge.sh` - Coverage Badge Updater

Automatically updates the coverage badge in README.md based on actual test coverage.

```bash
./scripts/update_coverage_badge.sh
```

**What it does:**
1. Reads line coverage from `coverage.xml` (line-rate attribute)
2. Converts decimal to percentage (rounded to nearest integer)
3. Determines badge color based on coverage:
   - 90%+ ‚Üí brightgreen
   - 80-89% ‚Üí darkgreen
   - 70-79% ‚Üí yellowgreen
   - 60-69% ‚Üí yellow
   - 50-59% ‚Üí orange
   - <50% ‚Üí red
4. Updates the coverage badge URL in `README.md`

**Requirements:**
- `coverage.xml` must exist (run tests with `--cov-report=xml`)
- `README.md` must contain a coverage badge

**Example Output:**
```
üìä Coverage line-rate: 0.8272
üìä Coverage percentage: 83%
üé® Badge color: green
‚úÖ Updated coverage badge in README.md to 83%
‚úÖ Verification successful: Badge updated to 83%
üéâ Coverage badge update complete!
```

**Badge Format:**
```markdown
[![Coverage](https://img.shields.io/badge/coverage-83%25-green.svg)](https://github.com/johan162/bayescalc2)
```

### `mkrelease.sh` - Release Automation Script

Automates the complete release process from develop to main branch.

```bash
./scripts/mkrelease.sh <version> [release_type] [OPTIONS]
```

**Arguments:**
- `<version>` - Version tag (e.g., `v1.0.0`, `v2.1.0-rc1`)
- `[release_type]` - Optional: `major`, `minor`, `patch` (for changelog)

**Options:**
- `--dry-run` - Preview release steps without executing
- `--help` - Display help message

**What it does:**
1. Validates version format and prerequisites
2. Runs complete build pipeline (`mkbld.sh`)
3. Updates version in `__init__.py` and `pyproject.toml`
4. Updates or creates CHANGELOG entry
5. Commits changes on develop
6. Merges develop ‚Üí main (squash merge)
7. Creates and pushes release tag
8. Syncs main back to develop
9. Cleans up build artifacts

**Requirements:**
- On `develop` branch with clean working directory
- All tests passing
- Version format: `vX.Y.Z` or `vX.Y.Z-rcN`

**Example:**
```bash
# Create release candidate
./scripts/mkrelease.sh v1.0.0-rc1 minor

# Create stable release
./scripts/mkrelease.sh v1.0.0 major

# Preview what would happen
./scripts/mkrelease.sh v1.0.1 patch --dry-run
```

### `mkghrelease.sh` - GitHub Release Creator

Creates GitHub releases using the `gh` CLI tool. **Run after `mkrelease.sh` and GitHub Actions complete.**

```bash
./scripts/mkghrelease.sh [OPTIONS]
```

**Options:**
- `--help` - Display help message
- `--pre-release` - Force marking as pre-release
- `--dry-run` - Preview without creating release

**What it does:**
1. Validates `gh` CLI is installed and authenticated
2. Checks no workflows are currently running
3. Identifies latest tag on main branch
4. Validates tag format and artifacts in `dist/`
5. Extracts release notes from CHANGELOG.md
6. Opens editor for you to review/edit notes
7. Creates GitHub release with wheel and sdist
8. Automatically determines pre-release status from tag

**Pre-release Detection:**
- Tags ending with `-rc1`, `-rc2`, etc. ‚Üí Automatically marked as pre-release
- Other tags (e.g., `v1.0.0`) ‚Üí Stable release
- Use `--pre-release` to force pre-release status

**Requirements:**
- GitHub CLI (`gh`) version 2.0.0+ installed
- Authenticated with GitHub (`gh auth login`)
- On `main` branch
- `mkrelease.sh` completed successfully
- All GitHub Actions workflows passed

**Example:**
```bash
# After mkrelease.sh completes and CI passes:
./scripts/mkghrelease.sh

# Force as pre-release
./scripts/mkghrelease.sh --pre-release

# Preview what would be created
./scripts/mkghrelease.sh --dry-run
```

**Artifacts uploaded:**
- `bayescalc2-X.Y.Z-py3-none-any.whl` (wheel)
- `bayescalc2-X.Y.Z.tar.gz` (source distribution)

## Usage Workflows

### Development Workflow

```bash
# Make code changes
vim src/bayescalc/commands.py

# Run full build pipeline
./scripts/mkbld.sh

# Check coverage report
open htmlcov/index.html
```

### Before Committing

```bash
# Verify everything passes
./scripts/mkbld.sh

# Review changes (including updated coverage badge)
git status
git diff README.md

# Commit
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add new feature with tests"
```

### Complete Release Workflow

```bash
# 1. Development on develop branch
git checkout develop
# ... make changes, add features ...

# 2. Build and test
./scripts/mkbld.sh

# 3. Commit changes
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add new feature"
git push origin develop

# 4. Create release (merges to main, creates tag)
./scripts/mkrelease.sh v1.0.0 major

# 5. Wait for GitHub Actions to complete
# Check: gh run list --branch main

# 6. Create GitHub release
./scripts/mkghrelease.sh

# 7. Verify release
gh release view v1.0.0
# Or visit: https://github.com/johan162/bayescalc2/releases

# 8. Optional: Upload to PyPI
python -m twine upload dist/*
```

### Release Candidate Workflow

```bash
# Create RC release
./scripts/mkrelease.sh v1.0.0-rc1 minor

# Wait for CI to pass
gh run watch

# Create pre-release on GitHub (auto-detected as pre-release)
./scripts/mkghrelease.sh

# Test the RC...
# If issues found, fix and create rc2:
./scripts/mkrelease.sh v1.0.0-rc2 minor
./scripts/mkghrelease.sh

# When ready for stable:
./scripts/mkrelease.sh v1.0.0 minor
./scripts/mkghrelease.sh
```

### CI/CD Integration

The `mkbld.sh` script automatically detects CI environments (`$CI` or `$GITHUB_ACTIONS`) and:
- Disables color output
- Skips coverage badge update (CI should not modify README)
- Generates XML coverage report for external services

## Understanding "Ahead/Behind" Status

After running `mkrelease.sh`, GitHub will show `develop` as "N commits ahead" of `main`.

**This is expected and correct!**

- `develop` preserves detailed commit history (individual commits)
- `main` uses squash merges (one commit per release)
- Both branches have **identical code**, just different history

The "ahead" commits represent the detailed development work that was
squashed into a single release commit on `main`.

**To verify code is identical:**
```bash
git diff main develop
# Should show no output
```


## Maintenance

### Adding New Build Steps

Edit `mkbld.sh` and add your step using the `execute_cmd` function:

```bash
execute_cmd "your_command_here" "Description of what it does"
```

### Updating Coverage Thresholds

Edit the badge color mapping in `update_coverage_badge.sh`:

```bash
if [ "$coverage_percent" -ge 90 ]; then
    badge_color="brightgreen"
# ... etc
```

### Troubleshooting

**Problem: "coverage.xml not found"**
```bash
# Solution: Generate coverage report first
pytest --cov=src/bayescalc --cov-report=xml
./scripts/update_coverage_badge.sh
```

**Problem: "Badge not found in README.md"**
- Ensure README.md contains the coverage badge
- Pattern: `https://img.shields.io/badge/coverage-XX%25-COLOR.svg`

**Problem: "sed: command not found" or syntax errors**
- Script handles both macOS and Linux sed syntax
- Requires bash 3.2+

## Script Dependencies

### System Dependencies
- bash (‚â•3.2)
- sed
- grep
- bc (for decimal calculations)
- git

### Python Dependencies
- pytest
- pytest-cov
- flake8
- mypy
- black
- build
- twine

## Best Practices

1. **Always run `mkbld.sh` before pushing** to ensure all checks pass
2. **Keep coverage ‚â•80%** - builds fail below this threshold
3. **Review coverage report** after adding new features
4. **Don't manually edit coverage badge** - let the script update it
5. **Use `--dry-run`** to preview build steps without executing
